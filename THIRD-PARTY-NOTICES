The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - murmurhash-js@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# MurmurHash.js

An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms.

These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance.

More information about these algorithms can be found at:

*	[MurmurHash Homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/)
*	[Wikipedia Entry on MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) 

## Install

    npm install murmurhash-js
    
## API

```javascript
var murmur = require("murmurhash-js")
```

### Methods

#### `murmur.murmur2(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur2 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

#### `murmur.murmur3(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur3 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

**Note** `require("murmur-hash")` is the same as `murmur.murmur3`

# remark-parse

[![Build][build-badge]][build]
[![Coverage][coverage-badge]][coverage]
[![Downloads][downloads-badge]][downloads]
[![Size][size-badge]][size]
[![Sponsors][sponsors-badge]][collective]
[![Backers][backers-badge]][collective]
[![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]

[Parser][] for [**unified**][unified].
Parses Markdown to [**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees.
Built on [`micromark`][micromark] and
[`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown].
Used in the [**remark** processor][remark] but can be used on its own as well.
Can be [extended][extend] to change how Markdown is parsed.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-parse
```

## Use

```js
var unified = require('unified')
var createStream = require('unified-stream')
var markdown = require('remark-parse')
var remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')
var html = require('rehype-stringify')

var processor = unified().use(markdown).use(remark2rehype).use(html)

process.stdin.pipe(createStream(processor)).pipe(process.stdout)
```

[See **unified** for more examples »][unified]

## API

[See **unified** for API docs »][unified]

### `processor().use(parse)`

Configure the `processor` to read Markdown as input and process
[**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees.

## Extending the parser

See [`micromark`][micromark] and [`mdast-util-from-markdown`][from-markdown].
Then create a wrapper plugin such as [`remark-gfm`][gfm].

## Security

As Markdown is sometimes used for HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up
to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of remark can also be unsafe.
When going to HTML, use remark in combination with the [**rehype**][rehype]
ecosystem, and use [`rehype-sanitize`][sanitize] to make the tree safe.

Use of remark plugins could also open you up to other attacks.
Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`remarkjs/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.
Ideas for new plugins and tools can be posted in [`remarkjs/ideas`][ideas].

A curated list of awesome remark resources can be found in [**awesome
remark**][awesome].

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].
By interacting with this repository, organization, or community you agree to
abide by its terms.

## Sponsor
